                <li>The user acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to risks of, use of, or inability to use, Parity under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that Eth Core Limited shall be not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data.</li>

              <div><b>LONG VERSION</b></div>
              <div>The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of Parity Technologies Limited’s open source software product (“Parity”). Prior to any use of the Parity or any of Parity Technologies Limited’s products (“EthCore’s Products”), the user or anyone on whose behalf the software is used for directly or indirectly (“User”) confirms that they understand and expressly agree to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, or affiliated with, Parity Technologies Limited (“EthCore”) is termed the “EthCore Team”.</div>
              <br />
              <div><i>Acknowledgement of Risks</i></div>
              <div>The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use Parity and expressly agrees not to hold liable EthCore or the EthCore Team should any of these risks occur:</div>
              <div>Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Parity Core Infrastructure Software</div>
              <div>Parity rests on open-source software, and although it is professionally developed in line with industry standards (which include external audits of the code base), there is a risk that Ethcore or the Ethcore Team, may have introduce unintentional weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of Parity causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens.</div>
              <div>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography</div>
              <div>Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and Parity, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, EthCore intends to update the protocol underlying Parity to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guaranty that any security updates will be made, timely or successful.</div>
              <br />
              <div><i>Risk of Ether Mining Attacks</i></div>
              <div>As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used by Parity is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum ecosystem, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the EthCore and the EthCore Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.</div>
              <div>Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the Ethereum Network</div>
              <div>If Parity is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum ecosystem could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy.</div>
              <br />
              <div><i>Risk of temporary network incoherence</i></div>
              <div>We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any ether deposited. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavour to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within the voluntary 24 hour waiting period.</div>
              <br />

Your use of these other services, software, smart contract or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, these Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.</div>
              <div>These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and EthCore and govern your use of Parity and EthCore’s Products (but excluding any products or services which EthCore may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and EthCore in relation to Parity and EthCore’s Products.</div>
              <div>You agree that EthCore may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by postings on the affected EthCore’s Product.</div>
              <div>You agree that if EthCore does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms (or which EthCore has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of EthCore’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to EthCore.</div>
              <div>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.

              <div>These Terms, and your relationship with EthCore under these Terms, shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, United Kingdom without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and EthCore agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within England, United Kingdom to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms (subject to the Dispute Resolution clause below). Notwithstanding this, you agree that EthCore shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</div>
              <br/>
              <div><i>Dispute Resolution</i></div>
              <div>All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of Parity shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be a UK resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice - in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court’s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant’s nomination. All nominations must be UK residents. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain “independent” of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be England, United Kingdom. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of England and Wales and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.</div>
